We have a React UI app (LexDraft) with a Settings page that contains multiple tabs/sections (General, AI & Providers, Documents, Agent Behavior, Privacy & Security, Notifications). Currently, when switching tabs, the tab buttons shift up/down because the content height changes. Also, the active tab styling has too much contrast (dark background + dark text), making it less readable. We also need a real Light/Dark mode that can be toggled in Settings and from the TopBar near the settings/avatar.

Please implement the following changes WITHOUT redesigning the app. Keep the current professional, calm styling.

1) Fix Settings tab navigation position (no layout shift)
- The Settings view should have a two-column layout:
  - Left column: tab navigation (vertical list of tab buttons)
  - Right column: tab content area
- The left tab navigation must have a stable, permanent position:
  - Make it a fixed-width column (e.g., 240px–280px)
  - It should not move when content height changes
  - Use `position: sticky; top: <topbarHeight>` OR keep it in a flex container with a fixed height and `overflow: auto` for content
- The right content area should scroll independently if the content is long, so the tab nav remains visible.

2) Improve active tab styling (reduce contrast, increase readability)
- Active tab background should NOT be very dark.
- Use a subtle highlight background (light gray in light mode, slightly lighter/dimmed surface in dark mode).
- Active tab text should be clearly readable (light mode: dark text; dark mode: light text).
- Add a left border or indicator for the active tab (subtle accent).
- Ensure hover states are also subtle and consistent.

3) Implement Light/Dark theme support across the app
- Add theme state with values: "light" | "dark" | "system" (system optional if already present).
- Persist theme preference in localStorage (e.g., key: "lexdraft_theme").
- Apply theme class to the root element (e.g., <html> or <body>) so it affects all pages.
- If using CSS variables, define tokens for:
  - background, surface, border, text, muted text, primary, subtle highlight
- Make sure both Settings and main app layout adapt correctly.

4) Add theme controls in Settings
- In Settings > General (or Appearance section):
  - Add Theme selector: Light / Dark / System
  - When changed, immediately apply theme and persist to localStorage.
  - Show a small helper text: "Applies across the entire app."

5) Add a theme toggle button in the TopBar
- Near settings gear + avatar area, add a compact toggle icon button:
  - Sun icon for light mode, Moon icon for dark mode
  - Clicking toggles between light and dark (if system mode exists, toggling switches to explicit light/dark).
- The toggle should reflect current theme visually.
- Keep it aligned and consistent with existing TopBar spacing.

6) QA acceptance checklist
- Switching settings tabs does not move the tab list position.
- Long content scrolls within the content pane, not pushing the tab list.
- Active tab is readable in both themes.
- Theme changes persist after refresh.
- Theme toggle works from TopBar and stays in sync with Settings.

Output:
- Update the necessary components (Settings view layout, tab styles, theme provider/hook, TopBar).
- Provide a short list of files changed/added.
